= Test Plan Matrix: What Goes Where

== Purpose
Map behaviors to the *lowest-cost layer* that proves them. Prevent E2E bloat; maximize fast coverage at unit/contract/integration layers.

== Target Distribution (Guideline)
[cols="30,20,25,25",options="header"]
|===
| Layer | Share of Automated Tests | Typical Duration | Confidence Role
| Unit | 70–80% | milliseconds | Rules, validation, pure logic
| Contract | 5–10% | seconds | API shapes, error semantics at boundaries
| Integration | 10–15% | seconds–minutes | Service+DB workflows in isolation
| E2E Acceptance | 3–7% (5–20 scenarios) | minutes | User journeys & deploy/config sanity
|===

== Decision Matrix
[cols="30,35,15,20",options="header"]
|===
| Behavior Type | Example | Layer | Why
| Field validation | qty range, email format | Unit | Exhaustive, parameterized, fast
| Cross-field simple | start <= end | Unit | Deterministic matrix
| Domain rule (no I/O) | price calc, tax rule | Unit | Pure function
| DB-backed rule | stock reservation | Integration | Needs persistence seam
| External API contract | payment 4xx/5xx semantics | Contract | Boundary guarantees
| Workflow across services | create→validate→persist | Integration | End-to-end inside system boundary
| Full user journey | login→buy→invoice | E2E | Business outcome & config
| Compliance UX presence | age gate visible | E2E (spot) | Thin UI check only
|===

== Risk Model → Layer
[cols="22,22,22,34",options="header"]
|===
| Impact | Likelihood | Detectability in Prod | Layer
| High | High/Med | Hard | E2E or Integration (prefer Integration if UI not essential)
| High | Med/Low | Easy | Integration or Contract
| Med | Med/Low | Easy | Unit or Contract
| Low | Any | Any | Unit (or omit if redundant)

== Promotion/Demotion Rules
* Move **down** the pyramid whenever a lower layer can prove the same behavior.
* Move **up** only when incidents show gaps or when deploy/config is integral to the risk.
* Every new E2E must include a removal or justification.
